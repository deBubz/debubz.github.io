In the docs, there are also guides for how to intereact with the Data Logger.</p> <h3 id="day-2-tuesday"><a href="#day-2-tuesday" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Day 2 Tuesday</h3> <p>The seccond day was rather tough for me, I wasn't prepared for how the structure of the Studio is layed out. Therefore, I find my self researching multiple different topics at the same time, not knowing where to start first.</p> <p>Dannon informed us with the <a href="https://blynkapi.docs.apiary.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blynk API<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a>, which could simply use  used some jquery and built a simple interface with the Blynk API. Because of the structure of the API, It worked as expected localy, unfortunately there was some trouble to get it working on Github Pages due to a protocol problem. GitHub pages requires all attached links to use https whereas the Blynks API only works with http. I did not manage to get it working but this is what it looks like.</p> <blockquote><p><img src="/assets/img/JqueryApi.2e775e1a.png" alt="An image"></p></blockquote> <h3 id="day-3-wednesday"><a href="#day-3-wednesday" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Day 3 Wednesday</h3> <p>I spent some time on the third day getting to know the people I'll spent my next 4 weeks with. The majority of my cohorts are Electrical Engineering majors whom I could learn from and maybe and brainstorm some problems to solve for this studio. Before comming up with a <a href="/summer/#what-problem-am-i-solving">problem I want to solve</a>, some other problems I came up are:</p> <blockquote><p>I find my self sitting for long period of times at home. Thus I could set a device that starts a timer when Im sitting and &quot;notifies&quot; (in a form of a shock) when the timer reaches a threshold.</p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>Even with weather forcast, It is difficult to estimate the weather conditions of your daily destination(workspace, school) to better prepare your attire for. My solution involves the user leaving a sensor at their workplace/school which allows them to make more informed decisions.</p></blockquote> <p>I also spent a part of the day trying to reverse engineer the source code for the Data Logger. Focusing on the <code>WifiMgmt.cpp</code> to try and figgure out how data is transmitted to the cloud from the esp8266 wifi chip. I could see what is used for what function but have yet figgure it out, they could be located in the missing <code>DataSync</code> files.</p> <h3 id="day-4-thursday"><a href="#day-4-thursday" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Day 4 Thursday</h3> <p>I get to experiment with a few new techs.

And Mqtt, a communication protocol which enables fast and lightweight Machine2Machine communications. With Mqtt, different machines(clients) would talk to each other through a Publisher/Subscriber communication system, facilitated by the Broker server(which is the virtual server on Vultr I had set up).</p> <p>Deploying the Mosquito Mqtt on the virtual server was alot more simpler than I thought. You can see It functioning as below.</p> <blockquote><p><img src="/assets/img/day4img.02cb1654.png" alt="An image"></p></blockquote> <h3 id="day-5-friday"><a href="#day-5-friday" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Day 5 Friday</h3> <p>The last day of the first sprint, I spent building my portfolio and doccumenting my progress so far.

The only issue is when ever I make a change to the site, I need to regenterate the Html files and push it on the Git repo. There are alot of guides that shows you how to apply CI(Continuous Intergration) feature by just simply update the md files, but I have yet to figgure out the correct configurations.</p> <h2 id="evaluation"><a href="#evaluation" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Evaluation</h2> <p>I dove into this Studio expecting a more structured teaching course, but the purpose of the studio is to build the ability of working independently without much supervision. Hence, I was struggling abit in this first Sprint. I need to change my mindset in approaching the Studio and in learning overal.
What I need to do first from now is figgure how I will Build this solution and break it down to smaller task.</p> <p>I'm glad that I'm able to attend this studio and did not give up. Even if I Failed this studio, I would have learned how to be better.</p> <h2 id="improvements"><a href="#improvements" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Improvements</h2> <ul><li><p>I should try to <strong>be more proactive</strong> during the Studio, as I always have been shown something new everytime I did speak up(Virtual Pi server with Vulture, Mqtt, Vuepress. )I'll admit that I thought that I didn't have much to offer as a first year student, I think I could offer some insight in the backend, programming side of the project.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Doccument my progress more often</strong>, both achievements and failures for review to change up my approach to learning.</p></li> <li><p>Focus on <strong>one problem at a time</strong>. I find meself bounching to different problems whenever I hit a wall, and wasting time researching various different topics, resulting in no feasable solutions.</p></li> <li><p>KISS - Keep it simple, stupid. A design philosophy states that most systems works best if kept simple.</p></li></ul></div> <div class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></div> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><span class="prev">
